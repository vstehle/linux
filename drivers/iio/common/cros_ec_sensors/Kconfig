	help
	  Module to handle activity events detections presented by the ChromeOS
	  EC Sensor hub.
	  Activities can be simple (low/no motion) or more complex (riding train).
	  They are being reported by physical devices or the EC itself.
	  Creates an IIO device to manage all activities.

config IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_RING

	help
	  Add support for handling sensor events FIFO produced by
	  the sensor hub.
	  A single device with a buffer will collect all samples produced
	  by the sensors managed by the CroEC sensor hub.
