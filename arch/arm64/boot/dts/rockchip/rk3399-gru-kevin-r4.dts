/* HACK for -rev4 to bump up voltage to make factory test more stable.
 * issue:55602(issue:54814?)
 *
 * With the new OPPs of bit/lit cpu, it's now more stable when changing
 * frequencies from 2088M/1608M to 600M/408M. But after testing stressapptest
 * on 5pcs, there is 1/5 failed.
 *
 * For the Gpu, the OPP in rk3399-opp.dtsi is from EVB boards, but on kevin,
 * it's easy to get error like "mali reset". A higher voltage helps.
