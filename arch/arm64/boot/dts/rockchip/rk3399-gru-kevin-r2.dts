/*
 * HACK for -rev0, -rev1, -rev2 to bump up voltage
 *
 * There's some extra voltage drop on early revs of kevin due to board layout
 * problems, so bump up all dvs voltage rails by 200mV.
 *
 * This 200mV is a bit of an estimate and hasn't been terribly well tuned but
 * seems to work OK.
 *
 * Because we are bumping up 200mV we also need to lop off some operating
 * points that would cause us to exceed the suggested 1.2V max.
 *
 * NOTE: The 'regulator-microvolt-offset' is not a terribly well-tested and
 * has some quirks (like I think it doesn't necessarily validate constraints
 * properly?), but seems to work and seems better than hardcoding every
 * operating point everywhere.
