TPM (Trusted Platform Module)

A TPM on the I2C bus is a child of the node for the bus.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "infineon,<chip>"
- reg: the I2C address

Optional properties:
- powered-while-suspended: present when the TPM is left powered on between
  suspend and resume (makes the suspend/resume callbacks do nothing).

Example:
	i2c@12C90000 {
		samsung,i2c-sda-delay = <100>;
		samsung,i2c-max-bus-freq = <66000>;
		gpios = <&gpa1 2 3 3 0>,
			<&gpa1 3 3 3 0>;

		tpm {
			compatible = "infineon,slb9635tt";
			reg = <0x20>;
                        powered-while-suspended;
		};
	};
