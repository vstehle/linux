pwm-backlight bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "pwm-backlight"
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
  - brightness-levels: Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these
      are in the range from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do.
      The actual brightness level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated
      from these values. 0 means a 0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the
      last value in the array represents a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
  - default-brightness-level: the default brightness level (index into the
      array defined by the "brightness-levels" property)
  - power-supply: regulator for supply voltage

Optional properties:
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the
               "pwms" property (see PWM binding[0])
  - enable-gpios: contains a single GPIO specifier for the GPIO which enables
                  and disables the backlight (see GPIO binding[1])
  - pwm-delay-us: delay between setting an initial (non-zero) PWM value and
                  enabling the backlight, and also the delay between disabling
                  the backlight and setting PWM value to 0.
  - brightness-levels-scale: this can be used instead of 'brightness-levels',
                             to describe a linear range of brightness levels.
                             So rather than specifying 'brightness-levels = <0
                             1 2 ... 65535>', one can simply say
                             'brightness-levels-scale = <0x10000>'. Note:
                             upstream maintainers haven't liked this sort of
                             property, since they'd prefer we describe the
                             levels in terms of a curve (e.g., parabolic) to
                             represent perceived luminance (?), but we've
                             always exposed the linear range instead, so rather
                             than unnecessarily bloating device trees, let's do
                             the simple thing.

Example:

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&pwm 0 5000000>;
		brightness-levels = <0 4 8 16 32 64 128 255>;
		default-brightness-level = <6>;
		power-supply = <&vdd_bl_reg>;
		enable-gpios = <&gpio 58 0>;
		pwm-delay-us = <10000>;
	};
